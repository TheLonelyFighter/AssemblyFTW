# AssemblyFTW

Assembly project written for a 8086. The main idea is exquisitely simple: multiply 2 NxM matrices.The input is given by the user using the keyboard. It took me roughly 500 lines to implement a functional version of the program. The end result was a renewed respect for high-level programming on my behalf. Next time I wrote a C++ function, I had a sort of epiphany.
